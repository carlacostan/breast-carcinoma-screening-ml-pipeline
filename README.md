## Project Description
A machine learning pipeline for automated breast cancer screening using whole slide images (WSI). This project utilises convolutional neural networks (CNN) for detecting breast tumours with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

### Project Aim:
The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for the detection of breast carcinoma using Whole Slide Imaging (WSI). This project focuses on building a robust tool for pathologists, improving diagnostic accuracy, and automating tumour detection.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Implement WSI data cleaning, normalisation, and augmentation to prepare images for analysis.
- **Model Development:** Develop and fine-tune a convolutional neural network (CNN) for tumor detection, leveraging transfer learning to improve accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix) and interpretability tools to assess model performance.
- **Visualisation Tools:** Design visual tools for pathologists to easily understand the modelâ€™s predictions and results.
